            <p>
                Schizophrenia is a mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People
                with
                schizophrenia may have trouble distinguishing between what is real and what is not. They might
                experience
                hallucinations, which are seeing or hearing things that aren't there, and delusions, which are false
                beliefs. Other symptoms can include disorganized thinking, lack of motivation, and social withdrawal.
                Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that requires professional treatment, typically with a combination
                of
                medication and therapy, to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

           <ol type="1"> 
            <li>
              <b>  Genetics:</b> Sometimes, schizophrenia runs in families. If someone in your family has it, you might be more likely to develop it too. But just because it runs in families doesn't mean everyone with a family history of schizophrenia will get it.
            </li>
            <li>
               <b> Brain Differences:</b> People with schizophrenia often have differences in their brain structure and how their brain works. These differences might affect how they think, feel, and behave.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>  Environmental Factors:</b> Things that happen in your environment, especially early in life, can play a role. This could include things like being exposed to infections before birth, complications during birth, or stressful life events.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>  Chemical Imbalances:</b> Our brains use chemicals called neurotransmitters to send messages. In schizophrenia, there might be imbalances in these chemicals, especially dopamine. This can affect how our brains process information and may contribute to symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
          <b>      Developmental Factors:</b> Some scientists think that problems during brain development, like disruptions in how the brain grows or forms connections, could be part of why people develop schizophrenia. Things like genetics, environment, and early life experiences might all influence brain development.
            </li>
            <li>
             <b>   Stress and Social Factors:</b> Stressful life situations, like trauma or major life changes, can sometimes trigger or worsen symptoms. Also, if someone grows up in an environment where they don't have strong social support or face discrimination, it could affect their risk of developing schizophrenia or how severe their symptoms are.

 <b>       Diagnosis
</b> </h1>
<div class="text">
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <b>  Initial Assessment:</b> A doctor, typically a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, will conduct an initial assessment. They'll talk to the person about their symptoms, medical history, and family history. They may also perform a physical exam and order lab tests to rule out other possible causes of symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>    Diagnostic Criteria:</b> To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must meet specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a handbook used by mental health professionals. These criteria include experiencing certain symptoms for a specific duration and ruling out other possible mental health conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
           <b> Symptom Evaluation:</b> The doctor will assess the presence and severity of symptoms, including positive symptoms (like hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (like lack of motivation and social withdrawal), and cognitive symptoms (like difficulty with memory and problem-solving).
        </li>
        <li>
         <b>   Duration of Symptoms:</b> Symptoms of schizophrenia must be present for a significant portion of time, typically at least six months, and cause significant impairment in various areas of functioning, such as work, school, relationships, or self-care.
        </li>
        <li>
         <b>   Rule Out Other Conditions:</b> The doctor will also consider other possible explanations for the symptoms, such as mood disorders, substance abuse, or medical conditions. It's essential to rule out these other conditions to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

    If you notice these signs, it's essential to seek help from a doctor or mental health professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend treatment options, which may include therapy, medication, or support services.
